# A workspace needs to have a name
# name: 

# Root path for included target libraries, which will be included
# as-such by generated artifact
# targetLibPath: libs

# Root where all the projects are found.
# projRoot:      proj

# Template library paths
# ======================
#
# All path lists are arranged in overriding order, from old to
# new. Objects from newer libraries override objects with the same
# name from older libraries. Configuration in this file is local to
# this workspace, and it overloads the variables in the global
# configuration (in <UserAppData>/conf.yaml). The variable $GLOBAL can
# be used to load values from the global configuration, at a specific
# place.

# Paths to component template libraries.
templatePaths: [$GLOBAL, usrlib]

# Paths to type libraries.
typePaths:     [$GLOBAL, usrlib]

# Paths to pre-defined native components used as functions.
nativePaths:   [usrlib]

# Projects
# ========

# All projects are listed under the following entry. All fields marked
# with '#!' are mandatory
projects:

# - name: myproject     #! all files will be under <projRoot>/myproject
#   description:        #  short and meaningful description for the project
#   target: c           #! target platform
#   top-modules: [main] #! list of top modules
#   all-defs:           #  list of files containing project source,
                        #  irrespective of what they might contain. It is
                        #  recommended to use the specialized variables below.
#   type-defs:          #  list of files defining _only_ local types. 
#   pattern-defs:       #  list of files defining _only_ component instantiations.
#   native-defs:        #  list of files defining _only_ native components.
#   docs-path:          #  path relative to workspace root where documentation
                        #  will be dumped.
#   code-path:          #  path relative to workspace root where target code
                        #  will be dumped.
